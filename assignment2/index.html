      <p>Hi My name is Karthik Nerella, I prefer "Karth". I just graduated highschool from Torrey Pines in Carmel Valley. I'm currently attending Palomar CC in order to transfer to USC for Buisness Administration. I have no experience with software, pretty much just what we have learned so far in this course and a little prep outside from a couple courses from Udemy and going through w3schools.com. I enjoy watching netflix, going out with friends, playing tennis occaisionally, taking photos, and finding new music. </p>

      <p>   I'm in this course mainly because I have taken an interest and I'd like to pursue a career in software for the time being in order to start saving up money to pursue my interests. My goal is to launch the clothing line "KED", and I am very interested in fast food franchises, I also have a couple auditions for TV shows coming up however they are not in california, but ultimately I would like to start a non-profit to finance the building of schools, irrigation channels and such in 3rd world countries. </p>

      <p>   I'm not good with details, and I struggle with staying focused for long periods of time. I also am really quick to give up when I struggle with an assignment/problem. I'm also not very good at asking for help and usually end up struggling by myself. Its one of the reasons I'm working with Evan he always knows how to motivate me and get me back on task. I am however very good with making connections, I love talking to people, I'm good at getting the right people, with the right ideas and personalities together.</p>
